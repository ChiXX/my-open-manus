# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version
#   is managed by the user of the library. However, for a dedicated environment, manually
#   specifying the Python version is useful.
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case you'd like to ignore it, uncomment the following line:
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipenv, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipenv, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
