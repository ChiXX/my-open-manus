# Examples

I have placed some examples in the `examples` directory. All examples use the same prompts as [Manus](https://manus.im/?utm_source=ai-bot.cn).

The model I use is `claude3.5`.

## Flight Query
Use Ctrip to search for low-priced flights from Shanghai to Hong Kong in the past month.

## Japan Travel Plan
**Prompt**:
```
I need a 7-day Japan itinerary departing from Shanghai (January 15-23) with a budget of 15,000-30,000 RMB, suitable for me, my wife, and our 7-year-old son. We love historical sites, hidden gems, and Japanese culture (Kendo, Tea Ceremony, Zen meditation). We want to see the deer in Nara and explore the cities on foot. I plan to propose during this trip and need a special location recommendation. Please provide a detailed itinerary and a simple HTML travel brochure including maps, attraction descriptions, basic Japanese phrases, and travel tips for us to refer to throughout the journey.
```
